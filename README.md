# Introduction
This is the repo for the Request For Comment and W3IF Improvement Process (W3IF-IP)

True to our core mission, we seek and value feedback from our community on improvements to the W3IF system.  This is achieved through Request for Comments.  Members of the community suggest improvements, the community weighs in and then we vote.

This bring into line the governance process within W3IF,  of which community members have a vote.  We have s governance contract that allows the majority to vote on improvement initiatives.

# Voting
Voting is governed through the community.  You cast your vote through the Governance Improvement Contract - address to be sent shortly.

# Approved Votes
Once approved, we work as a community to implement the improvement.

It must be noted, as we have multichain implementations, it some times takes a little while for the implementations to achieve parity.

# Improvement Promotion Process
Once a RFC is approved for vote via the Governance committee (meaning it has the required compoennt descriptions) it will be passed to the community for voting.
