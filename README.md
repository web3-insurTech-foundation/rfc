# Introduction
This is the repo for the Request For Comment and W3IF Improvement Process (W3IF-IP)

True to our core mission, we seek and value feedback from our community on improvements to the W3IF system.  This is achieved through Request for Comments.  Members of the community suggest improvements, the community weighs in and then we vote.

This brings into line the governance process within W3IF,  of which community members have a vote.  We have a governance contract that allows the majority to vote on improvement initiatives.

# The Improvement Process
We strive to keep it simple
- document your idea - see steps to do that below
- submit pull request
- w3if team will review and create vote in Governance Contract
- if approved - it will be assigned to implementation backlog

## Voting
Voting is governed through the community.  You cast your vote through the Governance Improvement Contract - address to be sent shortly.

## Approved Votes
Once approved, we work as a community to implement the improvement.

It must be noted, as we have multichain implementations, it some times takes a little while for the implementations to achieve parity.


# Content Structure
This repo is categorized via the problem domains of the Insurance Industry.  When creating new Improvements, please assign to correct domain.  If a new domain is required, please submit PR for it, it too will be reviewed.

Domain Taxonomy is as follows:

- CLA - Claims - processing of claims and claims management
- FIN - Finance - related to financial transactions with in the system
- PER - Persona - stakeholders in the eco system

- PRD - Product - the products that stakeholders purchase
- RSK - Risk / Cover - the items / assets that are at risk or need to be covered

# Improvement Process
To submit an improvement plan, the following steps are required
- clone this repo, 
- create a branch for your proposal - use the name of the next available IP # and in the subject domain (ie, CLA, SEC etc)
- complete your improvement idea
- send a pull request and we will merge into the main branch. 

Once a RFC is approved for vote via the Governance committee (meaning it has the required component descriptions) it will be passed to the community for voting.
