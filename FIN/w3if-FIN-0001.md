# Introduction

A Token Interface for receiving commission payments for work done on setting up / managing structures, running the system

These commission payments need to be traced, in addition to the blockchain trail.  We will need to account for this in the accounting systems.

This extends the concept of a Paid Oracle - however, its a paid contract.

# Simple Summary   

Decentralizing the operation of the insurance world means we need partition fees on a per instance (contract or transaction) basis.  This IP allows for a documented transfer of commissions to an Account Address.


# Abstract


# Motivation
A person sets up a product - we reward them by giving commission every time someone signs up for that product.  They get either fixed fee or percentage of the transaction - which the commission person defines

This will need to be verified as a commission transaction, which will show up as a transaction on the chain
