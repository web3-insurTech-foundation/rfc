# Introduction

A NFT Token Interface for receiving commission payments for work done on setting up / managing structures, running the system

# Simple Summary   

IE
A person sets up a product - we reward them by giving commission every time someone signs up for that product.  They get either fixed fee or percentage of the transaction - which the commission person defines

This will need to be verified as a commission transaction, which will show up as a transaction on the chain
